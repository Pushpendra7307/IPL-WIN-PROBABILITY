# IPL-WIN-PROBABILITY
Built a machine learning model to predict IPL match win probabilities using real-time match data.
The model takes inputs like runs left, balls left, wickets remaining, current run rate, and required run rate.
Trained using 57,000+ deliveries, it achieves 96% accuracy and adapts to various match situations and team combinations.
